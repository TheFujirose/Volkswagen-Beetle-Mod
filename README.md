# Volkswagen-Beetle-Mod
This is a mod for the game Rimworld; my first Rimworld mod. This mod features an inspired automobile from the 2019 and 1970 model volkwagen beetle. 


## Features
Inspired on the concepts of the original 1970 and the 2019 Volkswagen Beetle this design features a 'almalgamation' of both. Following the 2019 model this automobile is sporting the engine in the front and trunk in the back. The visual design hopes to achieve a almost 1970 model look.
