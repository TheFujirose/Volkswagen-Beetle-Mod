            <description>A blueprint for the Beetle; A road vehicle. It's suited for flat, terrain that operates well in various conditions due a modern redesign.
            It's relatively fast, but with poor cargo capacity due to the small trunk. Due to it's smaller frame 
            it's a cheaper reliable alterative.</description>
